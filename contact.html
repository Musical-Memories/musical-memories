                    Hi, I'm Paavni! I'm a current junior at Biotechnology High School! I have been playing the 
                    piano and flute for eight and six years, respectively, and as such, they have become two 
                    vital components of my identity. My musical experiences are something I cherish very much, 
                    and as I look back on them, each one seems more enchanting than the last. With 
                    Musical Memories, I hope to spread my love of music to you guys and make more 
                    wonderful memories along the way!

                Hi, I'm Pranshu, a junior at High Technology High School. I have many years of experience 
                playing the piano and trombone. I am fueled by a desire to create a vibrant community 
                centered around the universal language of music. With Musical Memories, I hope to spread

                    Hi, I'm Abhinav, a junior at High Technology High School. I have been playing the alto 
                    saxophone for over seven years. In that time, I have found a drive to spread the knowledge 
                    I've gained to others, as music is one of the most beautiful forms of expression in the 
                    world. At Musical Memories, I hope I can help give others a chance to experience the bliss 
                    I feel when I'm connected to music.

                    Hi, I'm Chinmayi! I'm a junior at Biotechnology High School. I've been playing the violin 
                    for 10 years now, and I've been playing the flute for 6. Music has brought so much happiness 
                    into my life, from the diverse knowledge it has taught me to the meaningful connections it 
                    has enabled me to form. I can't wait to share the joy of music with my community!

                Hello everyone, my name is Megan. I am currently a senior in high school. As of right now, 
                I am self-learning how to play the piano and planning to enroll in a music course at a 
                local college during the spring semester! I joined Musical Memories because I was deeply 
                intrigued by the hospice program. I wish to spread happiness and joy to everyone.
